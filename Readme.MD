##Search Git Repos
The Search git Repos app is a tool for searching GitHub repos .

###Installation
To install and run this app, follow the following steps:

clone this repo to your chosen directory.
You will need to install python3 on your machine. You can follow this guide. https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install dependencies 'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt'
run 'flask run' from the repo directory. e.g (venv) C:\Users\dan\Desktop\repoCrawler>python app.py

Using the app:
First, you'll have to open a browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Fill in the search criteria; note the programing language field is optional defaults to "all."
The app only displays the last ten results.



The "owner" of the app can find the admin dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin_dashboard.
This admin dashboard display all the results.

###Secuirty issues
For technical issues only, I left the GitHub token expose.
obviously that will never happen with "real" code.
